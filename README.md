# Identity-Preserving LoRA Style Transfer (IP-LoRA)

üìù **Overview**

**IP-LoRA** (Identity-Preserving LoRA) is a lightweight, modular, and diffusion-based framework for **portrait stylization** that preserves the **identity** of the subject. Built upon the strengths of **B-LoRA** and **ConsisLoRA**, IP-LoRA introduces a novel identity consistency loss derived from pretrained **ArcFace** or **DINOv2** embeddings to ensure semantically faithful stylizations.

This repository contains training scripts, inference pipelines and evaluation tools for reproducing all results in our [final project report](final_report.pdf).
